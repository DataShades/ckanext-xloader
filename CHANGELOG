v0.3.1 2018-01-22
=================

* Fix for exception about 'ckan.datapusher.url' not being set when you checking xload status #26


v0.3.0 2017-11-17
=================

* Trigger any resource_views to be created straight after load, rather than wait for the index.


v0.2.0 2017-11-10
=================

* Renamed ckanext-xloader
* Added to PyPI
* The user is given access to the data earlier in the job - the column indexing now occurs afterwards, since this is only an optimization for queries and takes much longer than the load itself
* Fixed exception during error-handling for files too long and of non-accepted schemes


v0.1 2017-11-03
===============

* Initial code, named ckanext-shift.
